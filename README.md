### Firefox Enterprise Policy

**NOTE:** Due to Mozilla Addon policy, this is not possibly with the Mozilla-hosted versions of the extension. You need to fork the extension and modify a hardcoded value to get this to work.

Due to the issue mentioned above, a privacy notice has to be displayed to follow the Mozilla add-on policy. This can be pre-accepted by setting the following Firefox Enterprise Policy:
```json
{
  "policies": {
    "3rdparty": {
      "Extensions": {
        "{ef87d84c-2127-493f-b952-5b4e744245bc}": {
          "consentOfflineDataCollection": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Building

First, clone the repo with:

```sh
git pull --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-web.git
# or, normal `git pull` and then:
git submodule update --init
```

Then build with:

```
make build
```

The resulting `aw-watcher-web.zip` can then be loaded into your browser in development mode. (for Firefox, loading unsigned extensions is only possible in Firefox Nightly and Developer Edition).

For further build instructions, refer to the `Makefile`.
