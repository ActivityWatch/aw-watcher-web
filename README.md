A cross-browser WebExtension that serves as a web browser watcher for [ActivityWatch][activitywatch].

It enables detailed browser tracking by recording the active tab's title, URL,
audible state, and incognito state. Without it, ActivityWatch can usually only
see the browser window title from desktop window watchers.

## Installation

### Official Releases

Install from official stores:

- [Chrome Web Store][chrome]
- [Firefox Add-ons][firefox]

### Development Build

Download the latest development build from our [GitHub Actions][gh-actions]:

1. Click on the latest successful workflow run
2. Scroll down to "Artifacts"
3. Download either `firefox.zip` or `chrome.zip`

> [!NOTE]
>
> - GitHub login is required to download artifacts
> - These builds are unsigned and require developer mode/settings

### Firefox Enterprise Policy

> [!NOTE]
> Due to Mozilla Add-on Policy, this is not possible with the Mozilla-hosted versions of the extension. You will need to fork the extension and change a hardcoded value to make this work.

Due to the above issue, a privacy notice must be displayed to comply with the Mozilla Add-on Policy. This can be pre-accepted by setting the following Firefox Enterprise Policy ([More about Firefox Policies][mozilla-policy]):

```json
{
    "policies": {
        "3rdparty": {
            "Extensions": {
                "{ef87d84c-2127-493f-b952-5b4e744245bc}": {
                    "consentOfflineDataCollection": true
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## URL in Window Title

Window watchers such as [aw-watcher-window](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-window) only see the browser's window title, which on most platforms doesn't include the URL. Enabling **Show URL in window title** in the extension settings adds the active page's URL to the window title, so they can categorize browser activity by site. It is off by default.

- **Firefox** prepends `<url> - ` to the window title. The page and tab titles are not changed.
- **Chromium browsers** have no API for the window title, so the extension appends ` - <url>` to the page title, which Chromium uses as the window title. This is also visible in the tab strip and history. It follows in-page navigation (`pushState`, `#fragment` changes). It can't change built-in pages (`chrome://`, the New Tab page, the Chrome Web Store, the PDF viewer), and has no effect on windows renamed with Chrome's "Name window". The URL is removed again before the title is recorded in the web watcher bucket.

By default the full URL is shown, e.g. `https://example.com/docs?page=2`. Window titles can be read by other apps and appear when sharing your screen, so turn on **Domain only** to show just the domain instead, e.g. `example.com/`. The domain is followed by `/`, so a rule matching `example.com/` won't match `example.com-other.net`. For loopback hosts (`localhost`, `*.localhost`, `127.x.x.x`, `[::1]`) the port is included too, e.g. `localhost:3000/`, since local servers often differ only by port.

## Building from Source

4. Enable the extension in Safari:
    - Open Safari
    - Go to Safari > Settings > Extensions
    - Enable "aw-watcher-web"

> [!NOTE]
>
> - You need Xcode installed to build Safari extensions
> - The extension needs to be signed with your Apple Developer account
